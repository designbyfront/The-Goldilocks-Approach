Goldilocks Approach
===================

A good starting point for responsive web design that takes device resolution out of the equation

How does it work?
-----------------

The Goldilocks Approach uses a combination of Ems, Max-Width, Media Queries and Pattern Translations to consider just three states that allow your designs to be resolution independent. Check out the example.html page included to see how it works.

It contains
-----------

* 2 well commented CSS files that consider 3 CSS Media Query increments; multi column, narrow column and single column
* Good typographic defaults out of the box (including print contexts)
* A boilerplate HTML file to get you started (index.html)
